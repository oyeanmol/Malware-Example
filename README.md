# Malware-Example
A collection of malwares/viruses/spyware code (not for real use) designed to teach malware analysis.

This is purely an instructional repository of malware code.
None of this is intended for real-life use and be forewarned that use of any of it is illegal almost anywhere in the world.
Please use this repository as a way to learn Cybersecurity forensics.
If there is a type of malware that you wish for me to create an example of for educational purposes, please leave a comment (include the language requested).

I hope that this can help people learn to protect themselves from these types of programs.

Thank you,
Anmol
